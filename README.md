# Hi.
This repo has my Personal thinking processes on how I actually thought about the solution in Kaggle to help me come in the top 10 in [Summer School's Hack II](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/thapar-summer-school-2025-hack-ii/leaderboard)

**WARNING**: The notebook contains a LOT of swear words, memes etc. as it is just my rough work. For the final result, refer to [my final submission notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thegenesis/top-10-solution-notebook-mae-243-08827).
